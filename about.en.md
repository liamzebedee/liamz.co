<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong>Liam Edwards-Playne</strong> and on the net I'm known as <strong>liamzebedee</strong>. I'm a teenager and have been coding since I was 11 with my friend <a href="//hetra.co">Jack</a>. I don't fuck around with superficial crap on my about page, I'd rather you form your own opinion of me. So here's some stuff from my life.</p>

## Free open-source software (FOSS)
I'm a supporter of and contributor to [free and open-source software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free—sw.html) (that's free as in libre). While I understand that propietary software has its benefits, I truly believe that a FOSS culture is viable.

### Contributions
I've loved FOSS since I discovered it, practically all the code I write is open unless it's unfinished. Here is a list of things I've built, somewhat in reverse chonological order:

* [bitWeav](https://github.com/liamzebedee/weav)
* [This Website](https://github.com/liamzebedee/liamz.co)
* [Thunderbird Tabbed Composition](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=449299) — I had been working on implementing the 5-year-old feature request to move composition into tabs, but we never got that far.
* [Dupcy](https://github.com/liamzebedee/dupcy) — simplified front-end wrapper for the magnificent duplicity backup software.
* [MediaWiki — Bug 45650](https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4565) — reported and fixed this.
* [Go — Issue 4296](https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=4296) — reported this.
* [gIMG](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc/tree/master/gimg) — helper plugin for the Anki software that simplifies the process of finding images for words so they can be learned visually. 
* Some WordPress widgets — [ShowMeTheStickiesInTheCat](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/showmethestickiesinthecat/), [Custom Category and Tag Page Titles](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom—category—and—tag—page—titles/)
* [go-BEncode](https://github.com/liamzebedee/bencode) — I added tags support for a BEncode parsing library in Go. 
* [Implementation of JBox2d’s DebugDraw using Slick2d](https://gist.github.com/3074904)
* [TiledMapPlus](https://bitbucket.org/liamzebedee/slick) — large chunk of functionality for Tiled Maps in Slick2D (2D Game Framework for Java)
* A large number of other things which can be found in my [misc area](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc). 
* TODO GifUnicorn, Bukkit Answers, Bukkit AccountLock, Cryptum WP Theme, TP WP Theme

## French
I've been learning French now for 2 years and I am loving both the language and the culture of France. In early summer this year I frequented the Brisbane French Language Meetup group. 

While I admit I am no expert in French culture, I do particularly like their foods and cinema. The idea of buying your food fresh each day is very different to what I experience in Australia, but I think the idea has merit to it.

## Competitions
### BuySmart
In 2012 I went to a shopping centre and filmed a 3 minute film about informing teenagers on saving money for the [BuySmart competition](http://www.fairtrading.qld.gov.au/buy-smart-competition.htm)...in the style of Bear Grylls. Needless to say it was extremely enjoyable and I got a Merit award and $50. See the video — [Man vs. Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECTO2J74GFw).

### YoungICTExplorers
I've entered this competition twice and coming up for third this year. 
* In 2011 (my first knowledge of it) I won 1st place in my division for a website and accompanying CMS I developed from scratch called Cryptum (I was 14 at the time). 
* In 2012 I won a merit award for a design of a peer—to—peer data structure based on a combination of techniques garnered from multiple pieces of research.
