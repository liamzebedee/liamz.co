Well today I woke up to find that some glorious bastard had posted the BitWeav whitepaper [draft] to /r/darknetplan. I had only just put up the website last week so that my school could view the whitepaper for my EE topic, dammit. Then the other night Google Scholar had found the paper. It seems SEO always works against me sometimes.

Anyways then I discovered it was posted to /r/bitcoin. Shit. I am so not ready it is not funny. Anyways the comments weren't too snarky, but there was some silly stuff that people posted, and it was clear that they had not read the whitepaper fully. Nonetheless I realised I needed to focus the BitWeav on its microblogging aspect.

So now I am faced with an uphill battle of not letting people know about it until it is ready. Ugh. Sigh. 
Also climbing a mountain at 2am this Friday to see a sunset.
