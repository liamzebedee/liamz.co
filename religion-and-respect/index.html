I began my transition to atheism after a realisation that my beliefs surrounding Buddhism were founded on <strong>simplistic moral principles</strong>, and had little to do with Buddhist concepts (such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#The_Four_Noble_Truths'>Four Noble Truths</a>). Throughout this time I had always been a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_naturalism'>naturalist</a> and had simply held these basic morals:</p><ul><li>Violence is unnecessary.</li><li>I should never directly inflict pain on animals or humans.</li><li>I should never take what is not given.</li><li>I should never lie.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></li><li>I should treat others how I wish to be treated.<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup></li></ul><p>Up until this age, <strong>Buddhism</strong> had been the most fitting description of my belief system, which is why I had never thought to question where I put myself.<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup> However, after some stirring Life and Faith lessons, I transitioned to atheism.</p><p>From 13 through 15 I was an avid and aggressive <strong>atheist</strong> to say the least. While I still maintain the criticisms I made against others beliefs and assertions, they were needlessly aggressive and overly ego-driven. I had become what is known as an <em>/r/atheism</em> personality.</p><p>Around 15 was when I realised that being proactively critical of others beliefs was ineffective, and I became <strong>Pastafarian</strong>. If I were to describe my ethical framework now, it would best be described as <strong>secular humanism</strong>.</p><h3 id='notes_on_pastafarianism'>Notes on Pastafarianism</h3><p>I think it is important to distinguish between the two different types of Pastafarians:</p><ol><li>those who follow it as an Internet <strong>meme</strong>.</li><li>those who understand the ideas behind the religion as a <strong>satire</strong> on intelligent design</li></ol><p>I place myself in the latter group and make sure to be explicit about the difference. The stereotype of a Pastafarian, combined with my technology background, usually leads people to believe that I follow Pastafarianism because I think the idea of a Flying Spaghetti Monster is funny.</p><div class='footnotes'><hr/><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>I later discovered these were essentially the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts#Pali_training_rules'>Five Precepts</a> — the basic Buddhist code of ethics</p> <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li><li id='fn:2'><p>also known as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule'>Golden Rule</a></p> <a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li><li id='fn:3'><p>A note on this topic: the media is inclined to simplify various ideas and arguments into categories. I find it difficult to explain my ‘hybrid’ beliefs to others, which contain ideas from multiple belief systems, as most people just want to establish which group I pertain to. However once you start classifying belief systems into different categories, you begin to develop stereotypes, which cause conflict.</p> <a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li></ol></div><footer> <nav><ul class="pager"><li class="previous"> <a href="/webrtc-p2p-criticism/" rel="prev" title="WebRTC is not true peer-to-peer">← Previous</a></li><li class="next disabled"> <a rel="next" title="">Next →</a></li></ul></nav> </footer></article></div><script src='/assets/global-97f9d015198f5b0dcf7371af279d5573.js'></script></body></html>
