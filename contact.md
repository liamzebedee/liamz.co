<p class='lead'>If you might care to comment on any of my posts or enquire to me about any other matter, please send me an email to <strong id="email"><a href="mailto:liamzebedee@yahoo.com.au">liamzebedee at yahoo.com.au</a></strong>.</p>

I'd enjoy it if the email contained an concise message with a meaningful subject. Also, don't use anonymous email, because I won't reply.
