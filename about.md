<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong>Liam Edwards-Playne</strong> and on the net I'm known as <strong>liamzebedee</strong>. I'm a teenager and have been coding since I was 11 with my friend <a href="//hetra.co">Jack</a>. I don't fuck around with superficial crap on my about page, I'd rather you form your own opinion of me. So here's some stuff from my life.</p>

## Free open-source software (FOSS)
I'm a supporter of and contributor to [free and open-source software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (that's free as in libre). While I understand that propietary software has its benefits, I truly believe that a FOSS culture is viable.

I run a FOSS operating system called Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a humanist philosophy which can be described by the quote:

> I am what I am because of who we all are.

Aside from the Microsoft Office suite (which is beautiful by the way and so much better than LibreOffice), my computer is a machine that runs entirely on free and open-source software. 

### Contributions
I've loved FOSS since I discovered it, practically all the code I write is open unless it's unfinished. Here is a list of things I've built, somewhat in reverse chonological order:

* [This Website](//github.com/liamzebedee/liamz.co)
* [CURRENT Thunderbird Tabbed Composition](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=449299) - I'm working on implementing the 5-year-old feature request to move composition into tabs. 
* [Dupcy](https://github.com/liamzebedee/dupcy) - simplified front-end wrapper for the magnificent duplicity backup software. I built this entire thing.
* [MediaWiki - Bug 45650](https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4565) - reported and fixed this.
* [Go - Issue 4296](https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=4296) - reported this.
* [gIMG](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc/tree/master/gimg) - helper plugin for the Anki software that simplifies the process of finding images for words so they can be learned visually. 
* Some WordPress widgets - [ShowMeTheStickiesInTheCat](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/showmethestickiesinthecat/), [Custom Category and Tag Page Titles](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-category-and-tag-page-titles/)
* [go-BEncode](https://github.com/liamzebedee/bencode) - I added tags support for a BEncode parsing library in Go. 
* [Implementation of JBox2dâ€™s DebugDraw using Slick2d](https://gist.github.com/3074904)
* [TiledMapPlus](https://bitbucket.org/liamzebedee/slick) - large chunk of functionality for Tiled Maps in Slick2D (2D Game Framework for Java)
* A large number of other things which can be found in my [misc area](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc). 
* TODO GifUnicorn, Bukkit Answers, Bukkit AccountLock, Cryptum WP Theme, TP WP Theme

## French
I've been learning French now for 2 years and I am loving both the language and the culture of France. In early summer this year I frequented the Brisbane French Language Meetup group. 

While I admit I am no expert in French culture, I do particularly like their foods and cinema. The idea of buying your food fresh each day is very different to what I experience in Australia, but I think the idea has merit to it.

## Competitions
### BuySmart
Last year in 2012 I went to a shopping centre and filmed a 3 minute film about informing teenagers on saving money...in the style of Bear Grylls. Needless to say it was extremely enjoyable and I got a Merit award and $50. See the video - [Man vs. Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECTO2J74GFw).

### YoungICTExplorers
I've entered this competition twice and coming up for third this year. In 2011 (my first knowledge of it) I won 1st place in my division for a website and accompanying CMS I developed from scratch called Cryptum (I was 14 at the time). In 2012 I won a merit award for a design of a peer-to-peer data structure based on a combination of techniques garnered from multiple pieces of research.

## Other things
In March 2013 I attended the [QLD UN Youth State Summit](http://www.unyouth.org.au/qld/summit/queensland-state-summit/). Needless to say it was one of the most enjoyable events I've been to this year, and I gained a lot of insight from it. I had the opportunity to enjoy a talk on foreign relations and the importance of international bodies such as the UN, spoken by the magnificent orator who is Kevin Rudd.
