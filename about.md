title: About me
---
<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong>Liam Edwards-Playne</strong> and on the net I'm known as <strong>liamzebedee</strong>. I'm a teenager and have been coding since I was 11 (<time class="timeago" datetime="2009-07-12T16:30:00Z">ages ago now</time>). My interests include coding, P2P networks, French, startups and business, design and typography, religion. I also have type one diabetes.</p>

I wrote this site in about 5 hours of a Friday night, <time class="timeago" datetime="2013-07-12T16:30:00Z">on July 12, 2013</time>. So far I think it's my best design, considering I didn't directly copy anyone this time (I took much inspiration from Medium.com and Svbtle).
