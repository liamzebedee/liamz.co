To describe it simply, it is a combination of Twitter and Skype, without servers. It allows for a bunch of people to communicate securely in two ways:</p><ol><li>Publicly, people can communicate by distributing 140 character messages on topics (identified by hashtags), and optionally in threads and in reply to other messages.</li><li>Privately, people can send private and encrypted messages between a group of nodes, and optionally do audio/video chat as well!</li></ol><p>The key difference between BitWeav and Twitter/Skype is that <strong>BitWeav is completely P2P and decentralised</strong>; BitWeav is based entirely on the computers of those who run it, not on Twitter or Microsoft’s servers.</p><h3 id='philosophy'>Philosophy.</h3><p>When designing BitWeav I simplified my philosophy into three key principles; BitWeav should be:</p><ol><li>Simple — the concepts (messages, threads) should be obvious and understood by the user already.</li><li>Secure — the security of the BitWeav system should be ubiquitous, and all messages should be authenticated and encrypted where necessary.</li><li>Sustainable — the product should be able to be relied upon by its users. To this a completely free and open design is key.</li></ol><p>In recent weeks we have seen many revelations surrounding the compromise of security of many popular services by the NSA for their PRISM program, including Twitter and Skype. This would’ve never occurred without these systems being closed-source and proprietary.</p><p>The proprietary nature of applications hinders security and reliability (in the sense of sustainability). For example, Skype is used by many businesses today, including news programs, to do teleconferencing. If Skype were to suddenly introduce mandatory fees for group calls, these businesses would have to either pay this new fee or undergo the hefty transition to another system — closed-source systems simply aren’t sustainable; <strong>you cannot rely on something that is not open and thus not within your control</strong>. This is precisely why I created BitWeav.</p><h3 id='the_project'>The project.</h3><p>Now you understand the basics of BitWeav’s functionality and philosophy, I implore you to read the <a href='http://bitweav.co/july-2013/whitepaper.pdf'>whitepaper</a> and <a href='/contact'>contact me</a> to help out.</p><p>While I have my full intentions to implement BitWeav, with my iB Diploma getting in the way, the product might not come as quickly as I would like. That is why I need you.</p><p>As Gandhi almost<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> once said:</p><blockquote><p>Be the change you want to see in this world.</p></blockquote><div class='footnotes'><hr/><ol><li id='fn:1'><p>It is apparently a misquote, see <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi#Disputed'>WikiQuote for more info</a>.</p> <a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'>↩</a></li></ol></div><footer> </footer></div></article></div><script src='/assets/global-4ffe7ff15391d97e1d75d989260326ee.js'></script></body></html>
