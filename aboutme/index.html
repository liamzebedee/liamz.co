	<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong>Liam Edwards-Playne</strong> and on the net I'm known as <strong>liamzebedee</strong>. I'm a teenager and I've been coding since I was 11 with my friend <a href="//hetra.co">Jack</a>. I don't fuck around with superficial crap on my about page, I'd rather you form your own opinion of me. So here's some stuff from my life to help you out.</p>

<h2>Free open-source software (FOSS)</h2>

<p>I&#39;m a supporter of and contributor to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free and open-source software</a> (that&#39;s free as in libre). While I understand that propietary software has its benefits (<a href="#">dictatorships are effective</a>) I truly believe that FOSS culture is viable.</p>

<p>I run a FOSS operating system called Ubuntu. Ubuntu is a humanist philosophy which can be described by the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am what I am because of who we all are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Aside from the Microsoft Office suite (which is beautiful BTW and so much better than LibreOffice), my computer is a machine that runs on freedom. </p>

<h3>Contributions</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve loved FOSS since I discovered it, practically all the code I write is open unless it&#39;s unfinished. Here is a list, somewhat in reverse chonological order:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m about to release this website. </li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=449299">CURRENT Thunderbird Tabbed Composition</a> - I&#39;m working on implementing the 5-year-old feature request to move composition into tabs. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/liamzebedee/dupcy">Dupcy</a> - simplified front-end wrapper for the magnificent duplicity backup software. I built this entire thing.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc/tree/master/gimg">gIMG</a> - helper plugin for the Anki software that simplifies the process of finding images for words so they can be learned visually. </li>

<li>TODO GifUnicorn, Bukkit Answers, Bukkit AccountLock, Cryptum WP Theme, TP WP Theme</li>
</ul>

<h2>French</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been learning French now for 2 years and I am loving both the language and the culture of France. In early summer this year I frequented the Brisbane French Language Meetup group. </p>

<p>While I admit I am no expert in French culture, I do particularly like their foods and cinema. The idea of buying your food fresh each day is very different to what I experience in Australia, but I think the idea has merit to it.</p>

<h2>Competitions</h2>

<h3>BuySmart</h3>

<p>Last year in 2012 I went to a shopping centre and filmed a 3 minute film about informing teenagers on saving money...in the style of Bear Grylls. Needless to say it was extremely enjoyable and I got a Merit award with $50. See the video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECTO2J74GFw">Man vs. Market</a>. </p>

<h3>YoungICTExplorers</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve entered this competition twice and coming up for third this year. In 2011 (my first knowledge of it) I won 1st place in my division for a website and accompanying CMS I developed from scratch called Cryptum (I was 14 at the time). In 2012 I won a merit award for a design of a peer-to-peer data structure based on a combination of techniques garnered from multiple pieces of research.</p>

<h2>Other things</h2>

<p>In March 2013 I attended the <a href="http://www.unyouth.org.au/qld/summit/queensland-state-summit/">QLD UN Youth State Summit</a>. Needless to say it was one of the most enjoyable events I&#39;ve been to this year, and I gained a lot of insight from it. I had the opportunity to enjoy a talk on foreign relations and the importance of international bodies such as the UN, spoken by the magnificent orator who is Kevin Rudd. </p>
