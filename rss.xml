	<description>Something that arises almost all the time in my conversations with adults is the concept of getting money for the purpose of getting money. It doesn&#8217;t make any sense.</description>

	<description>I had a dream last night that I was looking for cheese and feta triangles. Like, I had a real good craving for them. That was the entire basis of the dream. Just searching for this mystical food.</description>

	<description>I find that for the first time in my life, I have no conceivable bounds on where my interests lie neither any perception of &#8216;free&#8217; time — I am always occupied.</description>

	<description>Well today I woke up to find that some glorious bastard had posted the BitWeav whitepaper [draft] to /r/darknetplan. I had only just put up the website last week so that my school could view the whitepaper for my EE topic, dammit. Then the other night Google Scholar had found the paper. It seems SEO always works against me sometimes.</description>

	<description>A week ago I rebuilt my website, for what I had guessed would be the fourteenth iteration. The scary thing was that I was correct. Fourteen website designs ago, nearing the end of my first year at high school, I had started learning the languages of the web: HTML, CSS and JS. I was 12 at the time, and had no prior experience in web development. It started with a simple step: buying the domain cryptum.net.</description>

	<description>While camping I read a dystopian novel called We. I&#8217;ve read the classics of the genre – 1984, Brave New World, Animal Farm – but this novel, it was something else.</description>
