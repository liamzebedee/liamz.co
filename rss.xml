Instead of implementing the backend daemon first and then changing it later to support features needed by the frontend graphical client, I’m designing the graphical client first. I’ve already seen some of the benefits of doing this: when I was sketching the UI the other day, I found that I needed to implement a favourites mechanism. I knew that this was an essential part of the micropublishing framework, so I had to implement it at daemon level later. This is where my new top-down approach has improved the workflow: I’m spending more time designing for the user, and less time designing for the computer. Now this won’t work in all situations: when you’re under constraint by time or resources, and you haven’t devised a complete solution outline (like a design document, a whitepaper), you need to know the extent to what you’re doing before doing the frontend stuff first.</description> <category>article, Product design</category> </item><item><title>The productivity lies that I tell myself</title><link>http://liamz.co/ramblings-in-raw-text/productivity-lies-i-tell-myself/</link> <guid>/ramblings-in-raw-text/productivity-lies-i-tell-myself</guid> <pubDate>2013-08-11 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>Well this is just amazing. In the space of 4 uninterrupted hours last night, I wrote a 1500 word English essay. Then just now, in the space of about 5 hours, I wrote an entire 1000 word report on an experiment we did in Psychology. The latter I did with a couple significant interruptions.</description> <category>ramblings, </category> </item><item><title>Careers shouldn't be about money</title><link>http://liamz.co/careers-are-not-for-money/</link> <guid>/careers-are-not-for-money</guid> <pubDate>2013-08-10 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>Something that arises almost all the time in my conversations with adults is the concept of getting money for the purpose of getting money. It doesn’t make any sense.</description> <category>article, insight</category> </item><item><title>After Highschool</title><link>http://liamz.co/ramblings-in-raw-text/after-highschool/</link> <guid>/ramblings-in-raw-text/after-highschool</guid> <pubDate>2013-08-08 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>What am I going to do after highschool, I ask myself?</description> <category>ramblings, </category> </item><item><title>Strange dreams.</title><link>http://liamz.co/ramblings-in-raw-text/strange-dreams/</link> <guid>/ramblings-in-raw-text/strange-dreams</guid> <pubDate>2013-08-04 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>I had a dream last night that I was looking for cheese and feta triangles. Like, I had a real good craving for them. That was the entire basis of the dream. Just searching for this mystical food.</description> <category>ramblings, </category> </item><item><title>Our perception of time</title><link>http://liamz.co/ramblings-in-raw-text/perception-of-time/</link> <guid>/ramblings-in-raw-text/perception-of-time</guid> <pubDate>2013-07-24 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>Just had my wholly enforced views shattered by Robert, once again.</description> <category>ramblings, </category> </item><item><title>Business et.

I had only just put up the website last week so that my school could view the whitepaper for my EE topic, dammit. Then the other night Google Scholar had found the paper. It seems SEO always works against me sometimes.</description> <category>ramblings, </category> </item><item><title>The era of Cryptum</title><link>http://liamz.co/era-of-cryptum/</link> <guid>/era-of-cryptum</guid> <pubDate>2013-07-20 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description>A week ago I rebuilt my website, for what I had guessed would be the fourteenth iteration. The scary thing was that I was correct. Fourteen website designs ago, nearing the end of my first year at high school, I had started learning the languages of the web: HTML, CSS and JS. I was 12 at the time, and had no prior experience in web development. It started with a simple step: buying the domain cryptum.net.</description> <category>article, tech</category> </item><item><title>Announcing BitWeav</title><link>http://liamz.co/bitweav-announcement/</link> <guid>/bitweav-announcement</guid> <pubDate>2013-07-13 00:00:00 +1000</pubDate> <description> This post is now out of date, and is kept here for prosperity's sake.
