To be fair, I also quite enjoy learning about Psychology and Business. In fact, I just like learning things.</p><p>The near entirety of students I know will be going to university. I think maybe. I don’t know much about university now. Apparently it costs a lot of money, but HECS helps with that. I believe that education should be free, or at the very least knowledge should be freely available. The thing is, knowledge is available, sometimes for free and sometimes for a costly amount in a textbook.</p><p>I recently discovered I was an autodidactic learner, meaning I learn by independently teaching myself. The teaching aspect of university doesn’t seem that appealing, given my interest areas have abundant freely available education material accessible on the Web. With the advent of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera'>massively online open courses</a>, this too has been expanded to many more subject areas, and the movement has no signs of slowing down. Given a large enough number of people, the social aspect of a classroom can also be replicated freely by these social meetups for study. In this regard, the cost does not cover the education.</p><p>One thing that cannot be provided freely is that of testing. Testing that someone knows knowledge, and them passing that test, is what gives value to the pieces of paper known as degrees. These things are what employers seem to look for most, an evidence of knowledge (and I don’t blame them, the process of reviewing many job applications is rendered much more simple). So here’s one aspect to university which you can’t get freely: qualifications. Designing a syllabus costs money and testing that syllabus costs money. Our learning however should function apart from this.</p><p>Is there anything that I haven’t considered about university? To quote my father, university is where you make connections. Immediately an article comes to mind that illustrates my counter-point — <a href='https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/fb6d4028e452'>On adventure and reaching out</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Where our potential network of friends was once dictated by the number of people that lived in our home town, it is now relative to the number of people on the internet.</p></blockquote><p>In an age of global communication via telecommunications technology, I doubt that university can remain significant in this regard. It is just a matter of discovering people.</p><hr/><p>So this post was for me to collate my thoughts, and I have. University is a wonderful all-in-one package of tuition, meeting people and certification, but only the last is worth paying for. Internet technology permits a cheaper, more flexible education, so the only thing needed is certification.</p><p>On another note, <a href='http://www.uncollege.org/'>UnCollege</a> looks nice. I’ll end on a quote from some political campaign a few years back regarding education/schools:</p><blockquote><p>What if you didn’t have to fit the system. What if the system fitted you?</p></blockquote></div></div><script src='/assets/global-5d4664777616a94042a01bf3274f5aa6.js'></script></body></html>
