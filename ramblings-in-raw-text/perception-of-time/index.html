<h1 id='time_is_an_illusion'>TIME IS AN ILLUSION</h1>

<p>My previous perception of time was a linear progression of events essentially. Now I think otherwise.</p>

<p>Time is an illusion, created by memory of &#8216;past&#8217; events. Human memory is a substance that exists purely in the present.</p>

<p>Past events (the basis for previous my idea of time) are simply a perception of memory; we can only understand that a &#8216;past&#8217; existed from delving into the state of the present — our memories. You can never truly prove the past existed for the only evidence that it did was your memory of the present.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only moment which can possibly exist is this exact instance. Past is memory, and future is imaginary until it is present. We cannot even conclude to the past existing, as it is just a collection of memory. The past is a state; humans can easily grasp the concept of linear projection of state, but as you should know from computer science, linear projection is not the only method of projection. We can never prove that the past occurred, all we have is the current state.</p>
