Like, I had a real good craving for them. That was the entire basis of the dream. Just searching for this mystical food.</p><p>When I was young, around six or so, I maintained one certain dream that, looking back on it now, was the scariest fucking nightmare I have ever encountered.<br/>The basis of the dream was an existential crisis. I used to wake up, scared shitless as I pointed to the wall and mutterred some stuff. For many years I had no word to describe it — the content of the dream was always everything closing in on itself, just blocks and numbers connecting and then leaving the grasp of reality.<br/>And then one day last year I found a word for it — equilibrium. So yeah, I used to have existential nightmares as a child because I thought the universe was coming to an equilibrium and I was going to die.</p></div></div><script src='/assets/global-4ffe7ff15391d97e1d75d989260326ee.js'></script></body></html>
