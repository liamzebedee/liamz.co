<q>I met a man with a dollar. We exchanged dollars. We each still had one dollar. Then I met a man with an idea. We exchanged ideas. Now we each have two ideas.</q>

<ul id="all-quotes">
<li><q>Psalm 137:9 - Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</q></li>
<li><q>I met a man with a dollar. We exchanged dollars. We each still had one dollar. Then I met a man with an idea. We exchanged ideas. Now we each have two ideas.</q></li>
<li><q>We judge ourselves by our intentions and judge others by their actions.</q></li>
<li><q>You are who you are when nobody's watching.</q></li>
<li><q>If I am, death is not. If death is, I am not. Why fear that which cannot exist when I do?</q></li>
<li><q>Showing your own mediocrity is a sin.</q></li>
<li><q>When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.</q></li>
<li><q>The State (humanitarianism) forbade in those days the murder of one person, but it did not forbid the killing of millions slowly and by inches.</q></li>
<li><q>… we, on the Earth, are constantly walking over a bubbling, crimson sea of fire, hidden there, in the belly of the Earth. But we never think about it. But what if suddenly the fine crust of earth under our feet became glass, and suddenly, we could see…

I became glass. I saw into myself, inside.</q></li>
<li><q>When there is a state there can be no freedom, but where there is freedom there will be no state</q></li>
<li><q>Why don't we ever have plain dreams...we always have scary or crazy ones...maybe the days are just the plain ones.</q></li>
<li><!-- Zamyatin: Так замкнулся круг. Еще не знаю, не вижу, какие кривые в моей жизни дальше. --><q>There the circle finished forming. I still don't know which other curves I will encounter in my life</q></li>
