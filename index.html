<li><q>Psalm 137:9 - Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.</q></li>
<li><q>I met a man with a dollar. We exchanged dollars. We each still had one dollar. Then I met a man with an idea. We exchanged ideas. Now we each have two ideas.</q></li>

<li><q>Showing your own mediocrity is a sin.</q></li>
<li><q>When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.</q></li>
<li><q>The State (humanitarianism) forbade in those days the murder of one person, but it did not forbid the killing of millions slowly and by inches.</q></li>

I became glass. I saw into myself, inside.</q></li>
<li><q>When there is a state there can be no freedom, but where there is freedom there will be no state</q></li>
<li><q>Why don't we ever have plain dreams...we always have scary or crazy ones...maybe the days are just the plain ones.</q></li>
