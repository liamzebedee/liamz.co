# Being Efficient
1. Choose good problems
Work on the best problem you can attempt. 
2. Have a bunch of them
Having a lot of different projects gives you work for different qualities of time. Plus, you’ll have other things to work on if you get stuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).
It also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things you learn in other fields to the field you work in.
3. Make a list
The cognitive pressure of remembering everything you have to do is both large and unnecessary. 
Make a list of things you have to do, and then organise it by kind (reading, writing etc.)
4. Integrate the list with your life
Have a list of books you want to read? Put them in a pile in a fixed place, and go there always when you want to read. That way, you condition yourself to achieve tasks.

# Make your time higher quality
1. Ease physical constraints
Carry pen+paper. 
Avoid being interrupted
2. Ease mental constraints
Eat, sleep, exercise
Talk to cheerful people - It’s tempting to think that you need to get away from people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but this can be so demoralizing that it’s actually less efficient.
3. Share the load
Even if your friends aren’t cheerful, just working on a hard problem with someone else makes it much easier. For one thing, the mental weight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else there forces you to work instead of getting distracted.
4. Procrastination and the mental force field
Procrastination is a result of not understanding your problem. 
   * break down the goal into tasks - small, measurable, achievable
   * make it engaging to solve
