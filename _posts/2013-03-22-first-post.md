This is my first post on Liamz.co, so firstly, I shall begin with an introduction. This site is my only site now. I'm writing this post now in my favorite text editor thanks to Jekyll, the framework on which this site is built. It also happens to be the cheapest site I've built, hosted on Github Pages for free, which means I only have to pay the fee for the domain. 

Now, to the content. All my posts are based on my beliefs and thoughts, so I've categorised them into two groups according to how I structure the ideas:
 a) **Essays** are structured pieces
 b) **Posts** are lossy collections of ideas

To further illustrate the difference between essays and posts, I've changed the URL structure for posts to be under 'blog' - the casual connotations of blog are stronger than that of post. 

My last point is about the design of this site. I've stepped up my game, and low and behold, produced a mobile version of this site.
