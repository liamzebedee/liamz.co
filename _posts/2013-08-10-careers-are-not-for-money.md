title: "Careers shouldn't be about money"

Something that arises almost all the time in my conversations with adults is the concept of getting money for the purpose of getting money. It doesn't make any sense.

My idea of a career is that you do something you like for a living, and thus be happy. Their idea of a career is you do something for a living to get money, and then use this money to be happy.

As a person with a Taylorist mindset,[^taylor] I have no clue as to why you would add an extra step to the process of attaining happiness. Sure, many aspects of society don't make sense (see our convoluted social norms), but this is a fundamental principle of human living, to be happy, and for people not to understand the idiocy of this extra step is strange.

To explain my philosophy on work I use this quote:
<blockquote><p>
When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn’t understand the assignment. I told them they didn’t understand life.

[^taylor]:
Frederic Taylor was a man who basically started the [efficiency movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management). He contributed his ideals of improving overall worker productivity in the workplace by timing each task and refining its process to get it done faster. I originally learnt about him through [reading We]({% post_url 2013-04-27-we-zamyatin %}), as he is portrayed as one of their great figures of mankind.
