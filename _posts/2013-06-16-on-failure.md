<p class='lead'>I learnt this week the difference between failure and success, and the importance of making mistakes.</p> 

**Failure** is what happens when you make mistakes and don't learn from them. **Success** is when you do.


### Background
Being a student of the [International Baccalaureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme)[^ibStudent], a high school curriculum renowned for its difficulty, I have encountered 'failure' countless times this year. 

Last term I hadn't been focusing in HL French, something not very beneficial when trying to learn a language, especially in a higher-level subject. I had also been getting behind on school work in general, and hadn't had enough family time â€” it had come down to my **poor time management** and prioritisation skills. These things resulted in a less than optimal term.

And yet I put failure in quotes, because although I did fail myself in the most literal sense (by not achieving my goals), I consider myself to have succeeded. 


### The difference
The difference between failure and success is what you do with your mistakes.

A success reflects and learns from their mistakes, understanding how and why they occurred, and employs strategies to ensure they don't commit them again. 

Your mistakes don't define you, what you do with them does.[^idea]


### A quote
Nonetheless, making mistakes is essential to learning. I will end on a favourite quote of mine, which perfectly illustrates my ideas:

<blockquote><p>
My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn't have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. <em>Don't be afraid to fail.</em>

[^ibStudent]: First year of the Diploma program at this point.
[^idea]: Part of my new ideology and mid-years resolutions. I should make a post on it later.
