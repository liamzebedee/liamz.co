title: The era of Cryptum
description: "A detailed story of what was my longest and most loved project, my old website, Cryptum"

A week ago I rebuilt my website, for what I had guessed would be the fourteenth iteration. The scary thing was that I was correct. Fourteen website designs ago, nearing the end of my first year at high school, I had started learning the languages of the web: HTML, CSS and JS. I was 12 at the time, and had no prior experience in web development. It started with a simple step: buying the domain **cryptum.net**.

## The early days
The early days of my website began in year eight, my first year of high school. I was in a small group of friends who loved playing video games. I'd spend an afternoon playing GLTron and ragdoll fighting games with Tom. We talked about apps, how we could be millionaires and such. I truly did not care about what others thought of me at this time — I was an utter geek and proud of it (something I lost and now once again strive for). One life and faith class, we started talking about establishing a game development company, some basic business talk from 12 year olds:
> So if we make a game and sell it for $10, and like 200 people buy it (one quarter of our high school at the time), we would get around $1500!
We were stoked — fifteen hundred dollars could buy a lot, even in Australia. But we needed a name for our company ­— so combining the first letters of all our last names (Chant, Rasekhi, Edwards-Playne, Thompson and Maynard) we devised the name CREPTM. It sounded nice, but looked like an acronym generated by a Markov Chain; the spelling wasn't memorable. 

A few weeks passed, and I eventually got the idea to buy a domain name. I knew that my brand would be my most significant asset. I had previously set-up a website on Blogspot, dedicated to 'hacking' articles (which were really just naughty shell scripts) called HackerPort. Despite this I thought I needed something that was a little more like Slashdot — unique, but didn't outline what it was about. Spending hours at the computer, thinking about what could be the best name: LiamWEB, ZebedeeQ, etc. And then I thought back to my time in Life and Faith, with some twiddling, I came up with an nicer spelling of our convoluted acronym CREPTM, and devised the name Cryptum. 

So I bought the domain **cryptum.net**, which housed my website until early this year. With no understanding of how to build a website, I learned how to set up a basic *index.html* page. One month passes and now I have a purple dropdown menu built using simple CSS and some static content. Another month or two, I've learned PHP and have a basic custom-built CMS up and running (extremely vulnerable to SQL injections and the like). The most memorable thing however, was Cryptum's first logo, built in, you guessed it, MS Paint:

## Brezerd
By this stage, my best friend Jack, who I had began programming with the year before in primary school, had started his own enterprise: Brezerd. I too came up with this name, and to this day, I envy the name. I specifically remember the circumstance: we were talking over Skype on my 3rd generation iPod Touch (before every teenager had one), late at night, when he brought up the subject of names. After a few quick thoughts, I muddled with blizzard and came up with Brezerd. 

Despite the uniqueness of the name Brezerd, its initial results in search engines were hilarious, as its name was similar to the popular porn website Brazzers. By now the brand is more established, but I will never forget those days of stupid crap we did. Recently I discovered that the Internet Archive project have data archives of both our websites spanning back to 2010! [^cryptumArchives][^brezerdArchives] 
A particular [excerpt from Brezerd](http://web.archive.org/web/20111007045141/http://brezerd.net/) that made me fall of my chair laughing:

> As you may know, Progenitor Software is currently working on PimpSlap, a keygen written in native C++.

Some contextual information: at the time Jack and I, in our infinite teenage naivety, had been working on a new symmetric encryption algorithm to replace AES. *I'm cringing as I write this, and yet it gets worse*: for those who do not know, a symmetric encryption algorithm like AES works by operating on fixed-size pieces of data to encrypt, called blocks. These blocks are usually organised into 2D byte arrays, like a table. In my wisdom, I decided that no, I would not pertain to such structures studied and perfected over the years and instead, use a **triangular array** for my block data structure. The tedious idea of a triangular array is something I have never encountered in computer science (among other stupid ideas for data structures, this is the worst).[^stupidLinkedList] 
If you don't believe me, do see the [question I had asked on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5295200/what-is-the-best-data-storage-type-for-a-triangular-array) on how to implement such a useless data structure. Nonetheless, despite our stupidities, it still had the greatest acronym for a project in tech: JALEA — Jack and Liam's Encryption Algorithm.

Regardless, I still think it is incredible that among these petabytes of data spanning thousands of machines maintained by the [Internet Archive project](http://archive.org), we have the glorious honour of being part of it. These websites read by none other than us and perhaps a small group of ten friends is now stored **forever** in Internet history. Jack even jokingly said to me after I told him, that in years to come we show our children of what silly websites we built as teenagers.

## The 'renaissance period'
I'd describe iterations two to four as the renaissance period, wherein the content was lavish, and vulnerabilities were only slightly mitigated. After the **second iteration** of Cryptum I had redesigned the logo at least three times, as well as implementing comments for posts and a basic submission form. I miss this iteration the most — it had around 50 good interesting posts on it. It was really simple, just like [a place to post some short text files](http://textfiles.com), it focused simply on the content, with little to no superfluous data (author, blurb etc) — this is something I still look for in websites today, that which resembles most [Neocities](http://neocities.org/) and [4chan](http://4chan.org). It also fashioned an improved logo:

![Cryptum.NET Iteration #2 Logo](/data/history-of-my-website/cryptum-2-logo4.png)

These were the days. I was the first at my school to play Minecraft, and it was at only 700,000 sales (less than a tenth of what it is now). We set up Minecraft servers, explored the nether, awaiting eagerly the newest update from Notch which was sure to deliver. During History we would play Halo CE every lesson, messing with the crazy physics of the game on Blood Gulch with rocket launchers and warthogs (and yet I still got an A). 

Perhaps the most used service of Cryptum iteration #3 was the chat service I had built, referred to colloquially by my friends as 'Secure' (was located at secure.cryptum.net). About the only secure thing about it was that the messages stored in the database were encrypted (using a homemade encryption algorithm snippet from a website, which included the key in the source of the PHP code). It also had a naive AJAX update mechanism, so that the clients retrieved the new messages every second or so. The peak of its popularity was definitely in the ICT lessons in Year 9 (in which we were supposed to learn how to use Word and Excel, but we actually just chatted on 'secure' while playing games), wherein we had a race to reach the 10,000th message. I still remember when I did and shouted 'YES' instinctively, which had me a strange look from the teacher.

I'm happy to say that this version of Cryptum I did have a [source code backup](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc/tree/master/cryptum-customcms) of, as well as it being archived.[^cryptumArchives] The code here is probably matched to the fourth iteration of Cryptum, wherein I modularised the codebase (by this I mean I moved the code into different files, not using actual PHP object-orientated patterns). Despite the enormous amount of time I put into building iteration 4 (referred to as Cryptum 3.0), I did not use it for long, as I had made it very complex. Thus I had began my first exploration of pre-built CMS's, and came across my saviour WordPress.

## The WordPress days
The iterations in the WordPress period spanned five to nine — when you are given a tool that lets you focus on the design of the website, rather than how the content is stored/structured in the database, you tend to get more work done. I started using WordPress when it hit 3.0, and I got a book on it for Christmas (sometime in 2010). 

WordPress facilitated my rapid designing of my website, but I lost track of actually posting content. I think I had four blog posts and two pages at maximum during my time using WordPress. I generally was very concerned about **the look of the website**, rather than what was on it. My tastes were rapidly changing, which I can only attribute to puberty. In general my self-perception of who I was, and who I had been 6 months ago was completely different for a period of three years (between 13-16).[^jackPointed] 
A quick history of the designs:

Sixth iteration
: 	Using a WordPress theme built for photography. I later modified this for better typography but abandoned it because of its old stupid codebase

Seventh iteration
: 	I've written entirely my own WordPress theme based on Windows 8's Metro UI style. This was never released publicly but I have [published the code here](https://github.com/liamzebedee/misc/tree/master/cryptum-metro).

Eigth iteration
: something that looked niceish which I open-sourced. A WordPress theme based on \_s (WordPress theme framework) that had some nice HTML5 blur filters and looked really pretty.

Ninth iteration
: the last of the lot, this was a modification of the eighth iteration but this time using Bootstrap (no more terrible margins and padding). I also modified the typography a little more and made it nicer.

And so, as I came to iteration ten, I inadvertently decided I needed to change again. Back to my idea of simply raw content, I reverted to a MediaWiki installation, hosted for $16 a year on an obscure Asian company's servers. Like my webhost, the website was obscure and its existence was short. I set it up on the eve of 2012, thinking it was a place I could post my controversial thoughts without others knowing the author. A crazy idea that never came to fruition, the website was **4abf.net**. 

## Finality
And so I have come to the final four iterations, all relying on what is probably the realisation of my raw content idea: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). This is an end of an era, as I have discontinued Cryptum entirely in favour of the professional maturity of **liamz.co**. I think I'm probably emotionally stable enough now that I will no longer have these paradigm shifts in thinking, as Jack pointed out.[^jackPointed]

By this stage I am running Ubuntu Linux and using a command-line tool to build my website, which is demonstrative of my hacker personality. My eleventh iteration uses HTML5 and Bootstrap, and is very slick, although not responsive. My next iteration, the twelfth, is responsive and is a complete redesign. It's very simple although doesn't look nice. Iteration thirteen improved on the typography, and added multilingual capabilities. By this time I am writing articles again, just topping my maximum number since when I used WordPress. Nonetheless, I understand that the web is 90% typography, and even if I have good ideas, I need the accompanying style. So in 5 hours of a Friday evening, <time class="timeago" datetime="2013-07-12T16:30:00Z">on July 12, 2013</time>, I redesigned my website for a final time.

Welcome to finality, welcome to iteration fourteen.

## Afterthoughts
After writing this article I look at it and immediately think a couple of things.

Firstly is an insight about nostalgia. It truly is a wonderful feeling to have, and I think it is one of the few that is still held rare from the grasp of consumerism. It is something you cannot simply get on-demand, as with many things in my life today.

Another thought, more related to this article, is about what is was all really symbolic of. The quote from Brezerd about the encryption algorithm is really the epitome of our sophomore years in highschool. Messing around, playing with remote shutdown on the schools network (thanks Microsoft), doing stupid stuff was really a wonderful learning experience that I think should be available to all. Now as I am in senior years of highschool, it isn't all fun and games anymore. There is much work to be done, and it is all very ordered and precise, without regard for self-learning and experimentation. 

It was good to dwell on the past for a Saturday afternoon, writing this article. A meditative experience, if you will.
