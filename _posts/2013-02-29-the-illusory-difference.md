title: The illusive difference between unpaid and paid work
published: false

Today I had an **argument** (not a discussion persay) about the difference between what I do and what people working at McDonalds do. 

The basis of debate was whether there was a significant difference between:

* working freely as an open-source programmer, **as a hobbie**, and 
* working paid as a burger flipper at McDonalds, **to pay for wants**

I argue that there is not a difference.
