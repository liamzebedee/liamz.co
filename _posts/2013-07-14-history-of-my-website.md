1. Buy domain cryptum.net. Set up basic index.html page.
One month passes. Now I have a purple dropdown menu and some content. 
Another month or two, I've learned PHP and have a basic (but extremely vulnerable) CMS up and running. Also my first logo.
Perhaps three months and I have started building other services, including a 'secure' chat platform using AJAX. My friend Jack has also set up his website by this time. 
2. Second iteration of Cryptum — redesigned logo a couple of times, now I have comments for my posts and a basic submission form. I miss this version the most — it had around 50 posts on it. It was really simple, just like a place to post some short text files.
3. Third iteration — sidebars and some heightened (but still faulty) security. Introduction of TOPIC.Cryptum, static articles. Also I have started using a more modular development approach — including files from lib/!!
4. Fourth iteration — known as Cryptum 3, this was my largest redesign of the CMS yet. Divides content into articles, media (links and images etc.) and updates (short posts like Tweets).
5. FIfth iteration — my first move to another CMS, WordPress. Must've been around the release of 3.0. I started to use it after I attained a Wordpress book for a birthday while camping in Bunya Mountains. Cannot remember the design of it, but I know it was terrible.
6. Sixth iteration — I am using a different WordPress theme built for photography.
7. Seventh iteration — I've written entirely my own WordPress theme based on Windows 8's Metro UI style. This was never released publicly. 
8. Eigth iteraton — something that looked niceish. A WordPress theme based on _s (WordPress theme framework) that had some nice HTML5 blur filters and looked really pretty.
9. Ninth iteration — modification to the eigth iteration theme, but now I am using Bootstrap (no more terrible margins and padding). I also modified the typography a little more and made it nicer.
10. Tenth iteration — never actually pubished to the cryptum.net url, instead 4abf.net (first URL I bought since Cryptum). This was a MediaWiki installation and wasn't focused on me, just a broad stretch of underground ideas.
11. Eleventh iteration — by now I am fully on Ubuntu Linux, and embracing the culture, am using a command-line tool static site generation framework called Jekyll. I have bought liamz.co (win) and developed a HTML5 theme that uses Bootstrap. It looks slick, although not responsive.
12. Twelth iteration — my first ever website that is responsive. It too uses Bootstrap, but it is much less obvious. It doesn't look very slick, but it is very simple and was easy enough to make responsive.
13. Thirteenth iteration — some minor yet essential changes to typography, and multilingual capabilities makes this desserving of a 13. It was short lived.
14. Fourteenth iteration — slick, responsive and compressed. I wrote this site in about 5 hours of a Friday night, <time class="timeago" datetime="2013-07-12T16:30:00Z">on July 12, 2013</time>. So far I think it's my best design, considering I didn't directly copy anyone this time (I took much inspiration from Medium.com and Svbtle).
