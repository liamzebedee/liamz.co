My attitude towards religion is that of **critical acceptance**.


### Principles
I accept that people hold their own beliefs, and due to a multitude of factors including culture and personal experiences, they might seem strange to me. 

I will encourage people to **practise** their individual beliefs so long as they do not impact on others.

I will also encourage people to **discuss** their beliefs. Understanding ideas in culture, rather than harshly criticising them, is essential to constructive thinking. 

I will intervene when people impart their beliefs on others like **propaganda**.

Finally I remain **accepting** of people's differing views, but remain **critical** of their assertions.

### History
Up until adolescence (around the age of 13), I was a non-practising Buddhist. I began my transition to atheism after a realisation that my beliefs surrounding Buddhism were founded on **simplistic moral principles**, and had little to do with Buddhist concepts (such as the [Four Noble Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#The_Four_Noble_Truths)). Throughout this time I had always been a [naturalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_naturalism) and had simply held these basic morals:
* Violence is unnecessary.
* I should never directly inflict pain on animals or humans.
* I should never take what is not given.
* I should never lie.[^fivePrecepts]
* I should treat others how I wish to be treated.[^goldenRule]

Up until this age, **Buddhism** had been the most fitting description of my belief system, which is why I had never thought to question where I put myself.[^beliefSystemDescription] However, after some stirring Life and Faith lessons, I transitioned to atheism. 

From 13 through 15 I was an avid and aggressive **atheist** to say the least. While I still maintain the criticisms I made against others beliefs and assertions, they were needlessly aggressive and overly ego-driven. I had become what is known as an */r/atheism* personality. 

Around 15 was when I realised that being proactively critical of others beliefs was ineffective, and I became  **Pastafarian**. If I were to describe my ethical framework now, it would best be described as **secular humanism**. 

### Notes on Pastafarianism
I think it is important to distinguish between the two different types of Pastafarians:
1. those who follow it as an Internet **meme**.
2. those who understand the ideas behind the religion as a **satire** on intelligent design

I place myself in the latter group and make sure to be explicit about the difference. The stereotype of a Pastafarian, combined with my technology background, usually leads people to believe that I follow Pastafarianism because I think the idea of a Flying Spaghetti Monster is funny. 


[^fivePrecepts]: I later discovered these were essentially the [Five Precepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts#Pali_training_rules) â€” the basic Buddhist code of ethics
[^goldenRule]: also known as the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule)
[^beliefSystemDescription]: A note on this topic: the media is inclined to simplify various ideas and arguments into categories. I find it difficult to explain my 'hybrid' beliefs to others, which contain ideas from multiple belief systems, as most people just want to establish which group I pertain to. However once you start classifying belief systems into different categories, you begin to develop stereotypes, which cause conflict.
