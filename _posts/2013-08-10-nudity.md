I don't understand Australia's obsession with censoring the human body. What are these so-called negative effects of being subjected to anything more than impartial nudity?[^hmm]

Indecent exposure is the deliberate public exposure of parts of ones body which may be contrary to moral or local standards.[^indecentExposure] So the provision is that it is contrary to moral standards and thus is obscene in nature, or it doesn't fair with the local culture. 

What constitutes moral standards of the exposed body? It's subjective, quite obviously dependent on the culture. I would argue that nudity that has some sexual connotations 

sexual nudity beyond simple public affection 
The nature of the nudity is important.
