title: The productivity lies that I tell myself
---
Well this is just amazing. In the space of 4 uninterrupted hours last night, I wrote a 1500 word English essay. Then just now, in the space of about 5 hours, I wrote an entire 1000 word report on an experiment we did in Psychology. The latter I did with a couple significant interruptions.

I think this is definitely evidence that my potential is much greater than I previously thought. While I do have more work to do after this, I can now ride down to the shops, buy a 'pain au chocolat' (chocolate croissant) and enjoy the rest of my Sunday afternoon.

Maybe incrementally working on assignments isn't as effective as I had previously thought. For the English assignment, I stayed up until 12am (about 2 hours longer than I usually stay up) in complete focus. I switched off the wireless on my laptop and got into the zone. Previous to this I might've spent maybe 50 minutes in a 70 minute class (20 minutes of distractions at both ends) trying to write a measly 250 words. **The continual context switching is detrimental for my productivity**.
