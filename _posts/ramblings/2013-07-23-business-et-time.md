I find that for the first time in my life, I have no conceivable bounds on where my interests lie neither any perception of 'free' time — I am always occupied.

I also understand the old saying 'Time is money' now — I would rather the former nonetheless.

(Context: rewriting the BitWeav whitepaper, still convinced it can change the P2P communications space. Also have a bunch of work to do by Friday, as well as that non-metaphorical mountain that seems to be getting bigger each day.)
