<p class="lead">Hi, my name is <strong itemprop="name">Liam Edwards-Playne</strong> and on the net I'm known as <strong itemprop="nickname">liamzebedee</strong>. I'm a teenager and have been coding since I was 11 (<time class="timeago" datetime="2009-07-12T16:30:00Z">ages ago</time> now). My interests are extremely broad; I spend my time mainly coding, researching P2P networks, learning French and other things at <a href="http://qasmt.eq.edu.au/" title="QASMT" rel="nofollow" itemprop="affiliation">school</a>, reading about startups and business, design and typography, religion, reading dystopian fiction, watching films, and listening to rock music. I also two chronic diseases — type one diabetes and chronic hives.</p>

<p>As someone once said (I adore <a href="/quotes/">collecting quotes</a>): <q>Your actions speak louder than your words</q>. I'm not particularly interested in saying stuff about how great I am, I'd rather you form your own opinion of me based on what I've done. The stuff below is as close to a curriculum vitae as I've ever written (the list is not comprehensive), but I'm proud of all these things in some way or another.</p>

<p>To note, the vast majority of things below I am <strong>no longer working on</strong>. The interests, projects and other things I am currently occupied with are located on the <a href="/endeavours/">current endeavours page</a>.</p>
