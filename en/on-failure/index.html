<p class='lead'>I learnt this week the difference between failure and success, and the importance of making mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> is what happens when you make mistakes and don&#8217;t learn from them. <strong>Success</strong> is when you do.</p>

<h3 id='background'>Background</h3>
<s>Being a student of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme'>International Baccalaureate</a>, a high school curriculum renowned for its difficulty, I have encountered 'failure' countless times this year. Last term I hadn't been focusing in French, and as a result of...</s>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s not the real story behind this post. Admittedly I was quite disappointed in my academic results last term, but the experience that I draw this post from is not that. It was very much a social matter, and after saying some things online that I now regret, it lost me a friendship.</p>

<p>And yet I consider the outcome of these mistakes to be a success.</p>

<h3 id='the_difference'>The difference</h3>

<p>The difference between failure and success is what you do with your mistakes.</p>

<p>A success reflects and learns from their mistakes, understanding how and why they occurred, and employs strategies to ensure they don&#8217;t commit them again.</p>

<p>Your mistakes don&#8217;t define you, what you do with them does.<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id='a_quote'>A quote</h3>

<p>Nonetheless, making mistakes is essential to learning. I will end on a favourite quote of mine, which perfectly illustrates such ideas:</p>
<blockquote><p>
My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn't have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. <em>Don't be afraid to fail.</em>

<p>Part of my new ideology and mid-years resolutions. I should make a post on it later.</p>
