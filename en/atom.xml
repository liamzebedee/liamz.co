I had also been getting behind on school work in general, and hadn&amp;#8217;t had enough family time — it had come down to my &lt;strong&gt;poor time management&lt;/strong&gt; and prioritisation skills. These things resulted in a less than optimal term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet I put failure in quotes, because although I did fail myself in the most literal sense (by not achieving my goals), I consider myself to have succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id='the_difference'&gt;The difference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between failure and success is what you do with your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A success reflects and learns from their mistakes, understanding how and why they occurred, and employs strategies to ensure they don&amp;#8217;t commit them again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mistakes don&amp;#8217;t define you, what you do with them does.&lt;sup id='fnref:2'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id='a_quote'&gt;A quote&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, making mistakes is essential to learning. I will end on a favourite quote of mine, which perfectly illustrates my ideas:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn't have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. &lt;em&gt;Don't be afraid to fail.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Sara Blakely&lt;/small&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt; &lt;p&gt;First year of the Diploma program at this point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:2'&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of my new ideology and mid-years resolutions. I should make a post on it later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content> </entry><entry><title>On religion and respect.</title> <id>/en/religion-and-respect.en</id><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="http://liamz.co/en/religion-and-respect/"/> <updated></updated> <published>2013-06-12T00:00:00Z</published> <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My attitude towards religion is that of &lt;strong&gt;critical acceptance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id='principles'&gt;Principles&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I accept that people hold their own beliefs, and due to a multitude of factors including culture and personal experiences, they might seem strange to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will encourage people to &lt;strong&gt;practise&lt;/strong&gt; their individual beliefs so long as they do not impact on others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will also encourage people to &lt;strong&gt;discuss&lt;/strong&gt; their beliefs. Understanding ideas in culture, rather than harshly criticising them, is essential to constructive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will intervene when people impart their beliefs on others like &lt;strong&gt;propaganda&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally I remain &lt;strong&gt;accepting&lt;/strong&gt; of people&amp;#8217;s differing views, but remain &lt;strong&gt;critical&lt;/strong&gt; of their assertions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id='history'&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until adolescence (around the age of 13), I was a non-practising Buddhist. I began my transition to atheism after a realisation that my beliefs surrounding Buddhism were founded on &lt;strong&gt;simplistic moral principles&lt;/strong&gt;, and had little to do with Buddhist concepts (such as the &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#The_Four_Noble_Truths'&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/a&gt;). Throughout this time I had always been a &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_naturalism'&gt;naturalist&lt;/a&gt; and had simply held these basic morals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Violence is unnecessary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should never directly inflict pain on animals or humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should never take what is not given.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should never lie.&lt;sup id='fnref:1'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should treat others how I wish to be treated.&lt;sup id='fnref:2'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until this age, &lt;strong&gt;Buddhism&lt;/strong&gt; had been the most fitting description of my belief system, which is why I had never thought to question where I put myself.&lt;sup id='fnref:3'&gt;&lt;a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, after some stirring Life and Faith lessons, I transitioned to atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 13 through 15 I was an avid and aggressive &lt;strong&gt;atheist&lt;/strong&gt; to say the least. While I still maintain the criticisms I made against others beliefs and assertions, they were needlessly aggressive and overly ego-driven. I had become what is known as an &lt;em&gt;/r/atheism&lt;/em&gt; personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 15 was when I realised that being proactively critical of others beliefs was ineffective, and I became &lt;strong&gt;Pastafarian&lt;/strong&gt;. If I were to describe my ethical framework now, it would best be described as &lt;strong&gt;secular humanism&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id='notes_on_pastafarianism'&gt;Notes on Pastafarianism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to distinguish between the two different types of Pastafarians:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;those who follow it as an Internet &lt;strong&gt;meme&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;those who understand the ideas behind the religion as a &lt;strong&gt;satire&lt;/strong&gt; on intelligent design&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I place myself in the latter group and make sure to be explicit about the difference. The stereotype of a Pastafarian, combined with my technology background, usually leads people to believe that I follow Pastafarianism because I think the idea of a Flying Spaghetti Monster is funny.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class='footnotes'&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li id='fn:1'&gt; &lt;p&gt;I later discovered these were essentially the &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Precepts#Pali_training_rules'&gt;Five Precepts&lt;/a&gt; — the basic Buddhist code of ethics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href='#fnref:1' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:2'&gt; &lt;p&gt;also known as the &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule'&gt;Golden Rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href='#fnref:2' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li id='fn:3'&gt; &lt;p&gt;A note on this topic: the media is inclined to simplify various ideas and arguments into categories. I find it difficult to explain my &amp;#8216;hybrid&amp;#8217; beliefs to others, which contain ideas from multiple belief systems, as most people just want to establish which group I pertain to. However once you start classifying belief systems into different categories, you begin to develop stereotypes, which cause conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href='#fnref:3' rev='footnote'&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content> </entry></feed>
